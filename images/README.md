## To Replace Placeholders

1. Download the actual images from the original sources if still available
2. Replace the placeholder files with the real images using the same filenames
3. Ensure proper image dimensions for optimal display
4. Commit the new images to the repository

## GitHub Pages Compatibility

All images now use relative paths (`./images/filename.png`) which ensures:
- Images load properly on GitHub Pages
- No dependency on external hosting services
- Consistent availability and performance
- Better SEO and page loading times
